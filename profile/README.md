# Fédération Open Space Makers - Eve project

## Introduction

The goal of Eve is to design, build and operate open-source liquid-fueled rocket engines.
We are a diverse group of makers, engineers, students and professionals from all over the world, working together to make space more accessible to everyone.

We use Agile methodologies to manage the project, and we try to use open-source tools as much as possible.

## Project status

We are currently in the process of designing a 1 kN methalox engine, starting from the combustion chamber and propellant injector.
We are also working on the test stand, which will be used to test the engine.
